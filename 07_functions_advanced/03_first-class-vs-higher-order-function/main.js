// js treats functions as first class citizens. this means that functions are simply values.
// functions are just another "type" of object and since objects are valuse, functions are values too
// and we can store values in variables , return them from another function and more.

// function are objects and they have methods tool

// Higher order functions = A fucntion that recieves another function as an argument, that returns a new function, or both, this is only possible because of first class functions.
// a function that is passed in to higher order is called callback function. because the callback funciton will be called later by the higher order funciton.
